# Brewing

Unlike in vanilla Minecraft, brewing alcoholic drinks is not as easy as adding an Ingredient to a Brewing Stand and waiting for it to finish. Depending on the difficulty of the recipe, each step in the process may need a high degree of precision. Otherwise, the quality of the brew may suffer, leading to side effects like poisoning, and bad hangovers. The following steps describe the common procedure of brewing your own alcoholic drink.

### Fermenting

Step one consists of fermenting the fresh ingredients.

1. Place a cauldron over a fire or other heat source.
2. Fill it with water.
3. Add ingredients with by right clicking.
4. Wait a few minutes while they ferment.
5. Fill in glass bottles.

Use a clock on a cauldron to see the time the ingredients have been fermenting.

### Distilling
Some recipes don't need distilling.
1. Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand.
2. Put glowstone dust in the brewing stand ingredient slot. The glowstone acts like a filter, and will not be consumed.

### Aging

A barrel is needed for aging. 

**Minecraft Barrel** | _6 Slots_

The [Minecraft barrel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Barrel) can be used to age brews.
Simply craft and place the barrel and put the brews inside.

You can also build bigger barrels to age more alcohol. They can be built in two ways:

**Small Barrel** | _9 Slots_

Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape.

Place a sign on the lower right side and write "Barrel" in the upper Line:

A message "Barrel created" should appear.


**Big Barrel** | _27 Slots_

Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape.
Attach a spigot (fence) and a sign that has "Barrel" written on it:

A message "Barrel created" should appear. **You may remove the sign from the Big Barrel after creating it.**

------

Open the Barrel by clicking on it.

* Put your brews into the Barrels to age them.  
* For every Minecraft day, the brews will age a year.  
* Depending on the recipe, the type of wood used for building the barrel may alter the quality of the aged brew.
* The Minecraft barrel is always of wood type oak.

### Brew Sealing

Sealing your brew makes it unable to be modified any further by means such as barrel aging. It also equalizes the brew, making it similar to other brews that have been created similarly. This is useful for selling in your shops.

To seal your brew, you will need to create a Brew Sealing Table using the recipe below. Simply place your brews into the table, exit the menu, and they will be automatically sealed.

### Recipes

Listed here are most of the recipes available on Ultima, which are the default brews available from the Brewery plugin. Several custom brews require players to discover them on their own. The vagueness in these descriptions is intentional!
