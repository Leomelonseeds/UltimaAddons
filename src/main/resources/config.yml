        - "Kingdoms can be §2Paci- fist §ror §cAggressors§r. Pacifist Kingdoms can’t invade and can't be invaded, but also can't claim as many lands, and §ldo not §rmake passive income.\n\nPacifists can switch to aggressors, but aggressors cannot change to pacifist."
        - "Kingdoms can claim lands using §2/k claim§r, which are chunks that are protected from grief. Aggressor Kingdoms can invade other Kingdoms and take over their lands.\n\nThe §lInvasion Hand- book §rhas more information on how to start wars."
        - "The most important block in your Kingdom is the §lNexus§r, which is placed when you create the Kingdom. You can move it around with §2/k nexus§r. If your Nexus is captured by an enemy, your Kingdom will be §cdisbanded§r."
        - "From the §lNexus§r, you can level up your Kingdom by purchasing upgrades, structures, and turrets. You can also manage Kingdom shields, permissions, and ranks."
        - "All nexus purchases cost §lResource Points§r. You can gain resource points by depositing diamonds or diamond blocks within your Nexus’ resource point converter, and they can be withdrawn back into diamonds later."
        - "Use §2/k help§r and explore your Nexus to discover more Kingdoms features. Happy claiming!"

        - "§lInvasion Handbook\n\n§rSo, you want to start a war with another Kingdom. Here’s how."
        - "First, you need to declare war by using §2/k challenge§r. You’ll pick a preparation period of 1-3 days, after which you and the enemy are allowed to invade each other for up to §n2 hours§r. The exact war start time can be seen in our §3discord§r, in your local time zone. Don't miss it!"
        - "You can only declare war on §6neutral§r or §cenemy §rKingdoms. To cancel a war, request a neutral, truce, or ally relation with your opponent using §2/k [relation] [kingdom]§r."
        - "When war starts, use §2/k invade §rto start an invasion on an enemy chunk. You can only capture lands that are not completely surrounded by other enemy chunks - in other words, you can only invade chunks on §nenemy borders§r."
        - "After starting an invasion, the enemy §lChampion §rwill spawn. The Champion is a mob that helps Kingdoms defend their lands. It can be upgraded through the Nexus."
        - "To capture the chunk, you have to stand in it for §n3 minutes§r. Any defenders in the chunk will §lstop §rcap- ture progress from advancing. Defenders include enemy players, their allies, and the Champion. Failing to capture within §n15 minutes§r will result in a §cdefeat§r."
        - "If the invasion is successful, the chunk will become your Kingdom’s land. If you capture an §6§lOutpost §rland, all other lands claimed from that Outpost will be §6unclaimed§r. If you capture the enemy §c§lNexus §rland, the enemy Kingdom will be §cdisbanded§r."
        - "So get out there, become as powerful as you desire, and godspeed."
